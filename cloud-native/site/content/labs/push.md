title: Lab 2: Pushing a data service
---

In this exercise, you will push a RESTful data microservice.

> Note: Currently this microservice does not adhere to all of the 12 factor app principles.

## The App

The app is a very simple Spring Data REST application. You can download the jar file here: <a href="/resources/people.jar" target="_blank">people.jar</a>.

### Push

Use `cf push` to deploy the application.  You should:

* Create 1 instance of the app
* Allocate 750M of memory
* Use the `-p` flag to point to the jar file
* Use `--random-route` to ensure no collisions with other students

```sh
cf push people --random-route -b java_buildpack_offline -m 750M -t 180 -p /path/to/people.jar
```

#### Checking Your Work

Make sure your app deployed correctly:

```sh
cf apps
...

name     requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
people   started           1/1         750M     512M   people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io
```

The app also has an endpoint called `/people`.  You should also be able to curl it:

> On Windows, if you don't have curl you can get it from here: <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/download.html" target="_blank">curl.haxx.se/download.html</a>

```sh
curl people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/people
...

{
  "_embedded" : {
    "people" : [ ]
  },
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/people"
    },
    "profile" : {
      "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/profile/people"
    },
    "search" : {
      "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/people/search"
    }
  },
  "page" : {
    "size" : 20,
    "totalElements" : 0,
    "totalPages" : 0,
    "number" : 0
  }
}
```

## Adding Data

You can add data by issuing a curl request to POST to the people endpoint.  Be sure to replace your information and URL below:

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
  -d '{"firstName":"Jedediah,", "lastName":"Leland", "company":"The Inquirer"}' \
  http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/people
```

Now, you should see the data:

```sh
curl http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/people
...

{
  "_embedded" : {
    "people" : [ {
      "firstName" : "Jedediah",
      "lastName" : "Leland",
      "company" : "The Inquirer",
      "_links" : {
        "self" : {
          "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/people/1"
        },
        "person" : {
          "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/people/1"
        }
      }
    } ]
  },
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/people"
    },
    "profile" : {
      "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/profile/people"
    },
    "search" : {
      "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/people/search"
    }
  },
  "page" : {
    "size" : 20,
    "totalElements" : 1,
    "totalPages" : 1,
    "number" : 0
  }
}
```

### Restart your App

* Now restart your app with `cf restart people`.
* Curl your app again:

```sh
curl http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/people
```

What happened? Why? Not very durable, right? We will correct this in the next exercise.
