title: "Lab 3: Binding and Environment Variables"
---

In the last section, we lost all our data when we restarted our app.  In this
section, we will fix that.

## Creating a MySQL instance

We will create an instance of Mysql and bind it to our app, thereby removing
state from memory.

* Use `cf marketplace` to view the available services and plans.

* Use `cf create-service` to create a MySQL service instance `p.mysql` and
  select the `db-small` plan.

### Checking Your Work

You should be able to see your service instance:

```sh
cf services
...

name        service   plan       bound apps   last operation
people-db   p.mysql   db-small                create succeeded
```

## Binding to Your App

You need to bind your service instance to your application so that is can be used.

* Use `cf bind-service` to bind your service instance to your application.
* Restage your app so that it uses the new service: `cf restage`.

### Checking Your Work

You should be able to see your service instance bound to your app:

```sh
cf services

...
name        service   plan       bound apps   last operation
people-db   p.mysql   db-small   people       create succeeded
```

## Testing Statelessness

At this point, you should be able to put data into your service that lands in
the external MySQL service.

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"firstName":"Jedediah,", "lastName":"Leland", "company":"The Inquirer"}' http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/people
```

* Restart your app.
* You should still see the data:

```sh
curl http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/people
...

{
  "_embedded" : {
    "people" : [ {
      "firstName" : "Jedediah",
      "lastName" : "Leland",
      "company" : "The Inquirer",
      "_links" : {
        "self" : {
          "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/people/2"
        },
        "person" : {
          "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/people/2"
        }
      }
    } ]
  },
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/people"
    },
    "profile" : {
      "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/profile/people"
    },
    "search" : {
      "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.apps.training.gcp.gstack.io/people/search"
    }
  },
  "page" : {
    "size" : 20,
    "totalElements" : 1,
    "totalPages" : 1,
    "number" : 0
  }
}
```

> Congrats!  You now have a stateless app:

## How does it work?

Run the following:

```sh
cf env people
```

This will print the environment variables for your application.  Look for a
`System-Provided` variable called `VCAP_SERVICES`.  You should see the service
credentials for your MySQL service.  Note:

> * Cloud Foundry leverage the environment variables:
> <a href="http://12factor.net/config" target="_blank">12factor.net/config</a>
> * Cloud Foundry treats services as attached resources:
> <a href="http://12factor.net/backing-services" target="_blank">12factor.net/backing-services</a>


## Scale Out

By moving the state for your application into an external service, you can now
scale out your application horizontally.

* Use `cf scale` to scale your app to 2 instances.

> Notice that you can scale by adding instances:
> <a href="http://12factor.net/concurrency" target="_blank">12factor.net/concurrency</a>

### Checking your Work

You should see 2 instances:

```sh
cf app people
...

0   running   2016-05-17 09:53:40 AM   0.1%     376.8M of 750M   153.7M of 512M
1   running   2016-05-17 10:01:35 AM   0.0%     232.1M of 750M   153.7M of 512M
```

## Scale Down

* Use `cf scale` to reduce your app back to 1 instance.

> Notice that you can start quickly and dispose of unneeded instances gracefully:

## Beyond the Class


* Instead of using the “people” app, we can also use the
  [“Spring Music” demo app](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/spring-music):

        $ git remote -v
        origin  https://github.com/gstackio/training-zero-to-hero.git (fetch)
        origin  https://github.com/gstackio/training-zero-to-hero.git (push)
        $ git pull
        $ cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/cloud-native/spring-music

* CF also allows you to manipulate environment variables or create your own:
  <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html"
  target="_blank">docs.run.pivotal.io/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html</a>.
  Write an app that prints out all environment variables.

* With CF, you can create instances of services that point to existing endpoints with existing credentials:
  <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html" target="_blank">docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html</a>.
  Create a User Provided Service that points to a DB and bind it to an app.
