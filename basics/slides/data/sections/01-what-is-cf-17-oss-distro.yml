  **Where can you get Open Source Cloud Foundry?**

  * [**github.com/cloudfoundry**](https://github.com/cloudfoundry)
  * [**cfdev**](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cfdev) is CF and BOSH on macOS
  * **cf-deployment** requires [BOSH](https://bosh.io/docs) knowledge
  * **BOSH Lite v2** for a local CF deployment

notes: |

  Cloud Foundry is an open source project.  Using the OSS distribution requires BOSH (significant learning curve).
